# Graphics

This is the folder containing graphics. In order to create a clone that works across all platforms (i.e; Windows NT, macOS, Linux) We first need to pick a Graphics Library. Windows has DirectX, macOS has OpenGL and Metal, and Linux has Vulkan.
We can achieve the best of all worlds by utilizing bgfx, a cross platform rendering library that supports all 3 of those and several more. It even allows support for many different platforms. Such as the ones discussed above, along with Android, iOS, and RasberryPi.
bgfx has also be used by other minecraft clones, and they stand to show it capabilities in projects such as this one.
