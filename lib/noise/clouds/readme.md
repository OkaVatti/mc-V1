# Noise

Noise is one of the most important aspects of any minecraft clone. When attempting to emulate the terrain generation of the alpha versions of Minecraft, it's important to know what was used in the original.

## Perlin Noise

The terrain generation of the alpha versions of Minecraft were dependant on Perlin Noise. A type of Gradient Noise commonly used for projects such as this one. It does have its issues. Noise generators commonly breakdown after a couple million blocks away from spawn, Leading to the creation of "The Farlands." This isn't much of an issue though as it would take way too long to travel such a distance in Minecraft.
